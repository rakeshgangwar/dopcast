# DopCast AI Agent Architecture

## Agent Team Overview

The DopCast system uses a multi-agent approach where specialized AI agents collaborate to create engaging motorsport podcasts. Each agent has a specific role in the content creation pipeline.

## Agent Roles

### 1. Research Agent
- **Purpose**: Gather and analyze the latest information about MotoGP and Formula 1 events
- **Capabilities**:
  - Web scraping official motorsport websites and news sources
  - Extracting race results, standings, and statistics
  - Monitoring social media for driver/team statements and fan reactions
  - Identifying key storylines and talking points

### 2. Content Planning Agent
- **Purpose**: Structure podcast episodes and create content outlines
- **Capabilities**:
  - Prioritizing topics based on importance and audience interest
  - Creating episode structures with timing guidelines
  - Generating discussion questions and talking points
  - Ensuring balanced coverage across teams and drivers

### 3. Script Generation Agent
- **Purpose**: Write natural, engaging podcast scripts
- **Capabilities**:
  - Converting outlines into conversational dialogue
  - Creating distinct voices for different podcast hosts
  - Incorporating technical analysis and casual commentary
  - Adding humor and personality to the content

### 4. Voice Synthesis Agent
- **Purpose**: Convert written scripts into natural-sounding audio
- **Capabilities**:
  - Text-to-speech with realistic intonation and emphasis
  - Multiple voice profiles for different hosts
  - Adding appropriate pauses and timing
  - Emotion and excitement modulation based on content

### 5. Audio Production Agent
- **Purpose**: Enhance raw audio with production elements
- **Capabilities**:
  - Adding intro/outro music
  - Incorporating sound effects and race audio clips
  - Balancing audio levels and applying EQ
  - Creating final podcast file in distribution formats

### 6. Coordination Agent
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate the entire workflow and ensure quality
- **Capabilities**:
  - Managing the pipeline from research to publication
  - Scheduling tasks based on race calendars
  - Quality control and feedback integration
  - Triggering republishing for significant updates

## Agent Interaction Flow

1. **Trigger**: Race weekend concludes or significant news breaks
2. **Research Agent** activates and gathers relevant information
3. **Content Planning Agent** receives research and creates episode outline
4. **Script Generation Agent** converts outline to full podcast script
5. **Voice Synthesis Agent** transforms script into raw audio
6. **Audio Production Agent** enhances audio with production elements
7. **Coordination Agent** reviews, publishes, and distributes the podcast

## Technical Implementation

Each agent will be implemented as a separate module with defined inputs and outputs. The system will use a message-passing architecture to enable agent communication, with structured data formats for each stage of the pipeline.

Agents will leverage different AI models optimized for their specific tasks:
- Research: LLMs with web retrieval capabilities
- Content Planning: Planning-focused LLMs with knowledge of podcast structures
- Script Generation: Creative writing LLMs fine-tuned on podcast transcripts
- Voice Synthesis: State-of-the-art TTS models with emotional range
- Audio Production: Audio processing algorithms and ML models for sound enhancement
- Coordination: Workflow management system with quality assessment capabilities
